# Attention Detection 
#### Using openCV, deepface and technologies like convolutional neural networks and pre-trained models (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet). Detects wheter the user is 'Paying attention or not'. 
##### Gathers data from: 
- Facial Orientation
- Eye State (eye tracking)
- HeadPose


## Training Stage: 
### Created a script (branched), which collected data/pictures of user labeled Attentive vs. Distracted. 


## Goal 
### --> to create and train a Model which detects wheter the user is paying attention or not. To be able to deploy this model on different types of projects.
